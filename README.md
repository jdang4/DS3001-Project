# DS3001-Project

This is The Quaranteam's project for DS3001

## About Project ##
A user should be able to assess our models to choose the right apartment type in Daegu City, South Korea given their personal preference and budget. This project can help a potential renter or buyer predict the cost of the apartment based on their own financial situation, wants, and needs. It may be difficult to find qualities that their personal financial situation can afford as there are many factors involved in the decision. 

We hope that this model can be useful for workers who are thinking of settling into the Daegu City area, or people who are planning to temporarily live there for work. They can consider the size of the apartment if they plan to raise a family or include roommates, and they consider nearby public transportation as a means of getting to work.
